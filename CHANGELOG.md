# Changelog

## [0.1.0-alpha.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- Initial public release of bunql
- Bun runtime-focused SQLite wrapper with safe concurrent write handling
- Async FIFO WriteQueue for serialized writes
- TransactionManager with nested SAVEPOINT support
- RetryPolicy with exponential backoff and jitter for SQLITE_BUSY handling
- Prepared statement cache with LRU eviction
- Batch write operations with automatic transaction wrapping
- Lifecycle hooks and event callbacks
- Graceful shutdown with queue draining and statement cleanup
- WAL mode enabled by default for concurrent read performance
- TypeScript strict-mode support
- ESM build output with generated declaration files
- GitHub Actions CI workflow for lint, typecheck, build, and tests

### Improved
- Production-ready package exports and dist build structure
- SQLITE_BUSY detection using SQLite errno handling
- Error propagation with preserved original error causes
- Queue shutdown stability and drain handling
- Statement cache cleanup safety
- Documentation covering limitations, architecture, and usage guidance

### Testing
- 84 automated tests covering:
  - Write queue behavior
  - Concurrent writes
  - Transactions and nested SAVEPOINT flows
  - Retry handling
  - Graceful shutdown
  - Statement cache behavior
  - Batch operations
  - Stress and concurrency scenarios

- Added realistic workload stress tests:
  - 5000 sequential writes
  - Concurrent write batches
  - Mixed read/write/transaction workloads
  - Repeated open/close cycles
  - Cache pressure scenarios

### Performance
- Stable concurrent write throughput through internal write serialization
- Minimal write overhead compared to raw bun:sqlite
- Prepared statement caching for cache-friendly read workloads

### Documentation
- Added architecture overview and implementation philosophy
- Added SQLite limitations and tradeoff explanations
- Added concurrent write examples
- Added transaction usage examples
- Added guidance for when to use bunql vs PostgreSQL/MySQL
